## [Sloth Volleyball!][live]

A two-player, physics based, 2d "volleyball" game, implemented with the HTML5 Canvas. The live game can be found here: [http://maxfieldlewin.github.io/SlothVolleyball/][live]

To play, get another bored friend, coworker, employee or stranger, and gather around the keyboard! The left sloth is moved left and right with A and D, and jumps with W, while the right sloth moves left and right with the left and right arrow keys, and jumps with the up arrow key. Pressing space will pause or unpause the game, and pressing G restarts the game. Enjoy!

Features include:
- Jumping!
- Moving side to side!
- Moving side to side while jumping!
- A 2d Vector class written from scratch (mostly for the experience of doing so) used to implement gravity, acceleration, and something resembling friction

Features to look forward to in future versions include:
- Highly realistic 2d, semi-circular sloth graphics
- Googly eyes that follow the ball
- A mechanic for spiking the ball
- More consistent and realistic physics
